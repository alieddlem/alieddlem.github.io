  		Jack, from marmalade london design agency would look at my profile for sleek and simple web work. On their site, they have a very limited color scheme and use boxes to visually map out their site. Mine would be set up somewhat similarly with a few personal touches. Jack would be impressed with my simple logo and the way my nav bar works.
