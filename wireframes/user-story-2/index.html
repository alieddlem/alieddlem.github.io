  		Ben Dover, from Isite design in Boston, would view my site and notice that I've floated nearly everything on it, so that it's more flexible. According to their website, Ben would be looking for an intern who uses best practices, making everything mobile, and experience. My portfolio site would showcase all three of these characteristics to Ben before he even looked at my work itself.
